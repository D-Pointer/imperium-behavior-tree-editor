# imperium-behavior-tree-editor
A behavior tree editor for the AI component of Imperium. 

Imperium has an AI opponent for the campaign mode. The AI is scripted internally using a custom behavior tree. 
This editor allows the behavior trees to be edited with a visual tree representation. Nodes in the tree can be dragged
around and new nodes can be added and old nodes deleted as needed.
